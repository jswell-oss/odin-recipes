        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Prepare this easy homemade lasagne ahead of time and save in the freezer, uncooked, for when you need it during a busy week.</p> 
            <p>Then just bake for an extra 45 mins.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tbps olive oil</li>
                <li>750g lean beef mince</li>
                <li>90g prosciutto</li>
                <li>Tomato sauce</li>
                <li>200ml hot beef stock</li>
                <li>Pinch of grated nutmeg</li>
                <li>300g lasagna sheets</li>
                <li>White sauce</li>
                <li>125g ball mozzarella</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.</li>
                <li>Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.</li>
                <li>Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.</li>
                <li>Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.</li>
                <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).</li>
                <li>Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.</li>
                <li>Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, making sure you canâ€™t see any pasta poking through.</li>
                <li>Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.</li>
                <li>Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.</li>
            </ol>

        <h3>Tips for cooking and storage</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Lasagne takes roughly 45 mins to cook until deep golden on the top and crisp around the edges (the best bits for some).</p> 
                    <p>If you have prepared a lasagne and chilled it before baking it should still only take 45 mins. Once cooked, a lasagne will be too hot to eat straight away and is best left for at least 10-15 minutes to cool down for a better flavour.</p> 
                    <p>In Italy, baked pasta dishes are often served just lukewarm.<p></p></li>
